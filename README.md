# Spotidnldr

![spotidnldr - The Spotify Song Downloader](https://github.com/raprocks/spotidnldr/blob/master/cover.jpg)

## What is it?

A terminal based application written in Python3, which helps you download songs in MP3 format, with meta-data like artist information and album-arts just like on Spotify.

### Installation

#### Requirements

- Python3.6 or above
- ffmpeg (in PATH)

#### Installing Using pip

To install the latest **Release** just do

```sh
pip install spotidnldr
```

#### Installing from source repo

1. Clone the repo first (using git clone or downloading and extracting the zip)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/raprocks/spotidnldr
```

OR
download zip

```sh
wget https://github.com/raprocks/spotidnldr/archive/master.zip
```

unzip it

```sh
unzip master.zip
```

2. Change Working directory to the project root and do

```sh
pip install .
```

### This installs the required packages from Pypi repo

- spotipy - The python wrapper for Spotify's Web API.
- requests - The HTTP library used to get data from Youtube.
- youtube-dl - The awesome masterpiece to get audio files.
- ffmpeg-python - The ffmpeg wrapper for python
- eyeD3 - The Meta-Data Writer
- Click - The module which converts the package to a CLI app.
- ytmusicapi - the module which retrives youtube links of songs.

  You will probably need the root user permissions if you are on a linux system or Mac. Just add **sudo** at the begining of the command and it should work without any issues.

3. Done.

#### Installing in Termux

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raprocks/spotidnldr/master/termux_setup.sh >> "termux_setup.sh" && sh termux_setup.sh
```

This script above will setup spotidnldr for your device on termux, making the songs folder, setting up the environment and setting up permissions.
